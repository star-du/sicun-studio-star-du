  <dt id="1">It's still part of the internet.</dt>
  <dd>Traditionally, the World Wide Web has been accessed via fixed-line services on laptops and desktop computers.
  However, the Web is now more accessible by portable and wireless devices.
  And mobile web or so-called mobile internet (known as ‘移动互联’in Chinese) 
  refers to access to the Internet via a cellular telephone service provider. 
  Wi-Fi and other better methods are commonly seen as part of the mobile internet,
  but this is not the meaning of "mobile" here.
  It is wireless access that can handoff to another radio tower while it is moving across the service area, 
  such as using your cellular data to browse a web page while sitting on a bus.</dd><br>
  <dt id="2">How's it doing now?</dt>
  <dd>If you are willing to explore the full history or development of mobile internet, I’ve had some useful stuffs for you. 
  But for many of you who are just trying to figure out what it means, the above info is quite enough.
  Mobile internet has also been called Web 3.0, mainly due to its ability to have an “on the go” internet access,
  but problems may be encountered include the higher cost, the screen size (often too small), 
  and those broken or compressed pages that frustrate users. But optimizing and new standards are bringing things a lot better. 
  The emerge of Google’s amp to accelerate the web loading speed, and web service providers’ struggles 
  (such as AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-mobile in U.S. and China’s China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom) are helping to maximize 
  the upload and download speed. Also, HTML and CSS designers are making the web page we see more responsive than ever. 
  As a blogger puts it, We are drawn closer and closer to the mature of Web 3.0. <dd><br>
  <dt>It's shaping the following generations</dt>
  <dd id="3">Mobile internet is the important game-changer considering the amazingly great number of mobile users, 
  many of whom have regarded mobiles as necessities. 
  Mobile web provides users a greater sense of privacy and personality 
  and connects customers with companies or shop-owners directly and precisely. With all those services on-line within easy reach, 
  the frequent users, especially those younger generations, are more and more at ease with speaking out their demands and pursuing
  the best service or goods available (rather than make do with the second best). Social network develops with unprecedented speed
  thanks to mobile web, people shares any bits of emotions and thoughts whenever they want, and can get responses almost instantly, 
  thus a growing tendency of self-expression or even self-deprecating (in Chinese ‘自黑’) can be seen.
  We can safely assume that generations growing under the influence of the more-powerful-than-ever social network may 
  view themselves and the relationship around them in quite different ways, and this shall be the subject studied by sociologists 
  and psychologists now and future. </dd>

  <p>There are several options today for going online with your laptop or cell phone while on the go. 
  These mobile Internet access options range from using free wi-fi at a hotspot to having a mobile broadband (e.g., 3G) network device 
  on your laptop or buying a mobile hotspot device for "anywhere, anytime" Internet access over a cellular network.</p>

	  <li>These are public locations (airports, hotels, coffeeshops) where you can connect your smartphone or laptop 
	  wirelessly to the establishment's Internet service.</li>
      <li>Pros: many hotspots are free, you can find them fairly easily in urban and suburban areas, and food and drinks are often available for purchase</li>
      <li>Cons: Can be costly even if it's free (you should buy the establishment's coffee/food/etc. That's rule #3 in The Starbuckian Handbook)
	  Wi-Fi hotspots are also usually unsecured (no WPA encryption),
	  and to use the hotspot you have to locate it first, then physically be within range of the hotspot's access point.</li></ul>

	  <li>Using a built-in mobile broadband card or a USB modem on your laptop or portable mobile hotspot device,
	  you can get high speed wireless Internet on your laptop wherever you go.</li>
	  <li>Pros: Go online anywhere you have a cellular signal, speeds comparable to residential DSL</li>

  <p>Although 4G is always claimed as a lot faster than its predecessor,it's speed is still 
  not as good as normal WIFI nowadays.</p>
  <p>As we can see in the graph below, the average 4g speed is no more than 20Mbps, which might even suffer 
 from the rolling out of unlimited-data package.<br>
 <img src="images/4G-Data-Speeds-US-Jun-2017.png" alt="4g speed" width="70%">
 <div style="clear:left">To the contrary, the 50Mbps or 100Mbps networks are getting popular, the 
 tech Giant Google has even rolled out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fiber">Google Fiber</a> , which claims an insainly 1 Gbit/s internet speed.
  <p>So maybe the hope lies in 5G, which, according to the <abbr>NMNA:</abbr></p>
  <blockquote>In addition to providing simply faster speeds, they predict that 5G networks also will need to meet new use cases,
  such as the Internet of Things (internet connected devices), 
  as well as broadcast-like services and lifeline communication in times of natural disaster. </blockquote></div>
